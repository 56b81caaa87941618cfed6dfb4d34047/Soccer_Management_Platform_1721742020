The user was presented with multiple lists of additional features to consider, emphasizing options like live match score updates, customizable user profiles, real-time chat rooms, fixture schedules, a news section, a dynamic banner showcasing latest soccer champions, a real-time updated leaderboard, and user personalization for favorite teams. While some features like interactive team and player stats dashboards, match discussions, and trivia quizzes were offered, they were not marked as selected according to the user's preferences. In a different vein, the user was queried on specific app elements, such as the primary purpose of a form (user registration or profile updates), field labels, background colors, text font and sizes, and header text changes across the app with styling preferences. The user explicitly requested the creation of a form with text fields, gender radio buttons, and a button, changing the 'Get the App' background color to blue with white text, and updating the header text to 'Soccer Champion of World.' The AI acknowledged these requests, confirming its capability to undertake these tasks and prompting for more detailed project descriptions.",
